        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Implement Kahn's algorithm for topological sorting of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The algorithm uses the concept of in-degrees to process nodes in the correct order.</p>
        <p>Given a directed graph, return a topological ordering of the nodes, or report that a cycle exists.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Given a graph with edges [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 3), (2, 3)], return the topological order [0, 1, 2, 3].</li>
            <li>Given a graph with edges [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0)], return that the graph contains a cycle.</li>
        </ul>
