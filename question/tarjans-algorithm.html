        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Implement Tarjan's algorithm to find the strongly connected components (SCCs) in a directed graph. Tarjan's algorithm uses depth-first search (DFS) to find and output all SCCs.</p>
        <p>Given a directed graph, return a list of SCCs where each SCC is a list of nodes that form a strongly connected component.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Given a graph with edges [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (3, 4)], return the strongly connected components: [[0, 1, 2], [3, 4]].</li>
        </ul>
