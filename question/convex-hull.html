        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Given a set of points in a 2D plane, find the convex hull of the set, which is the smallest convex polygon that contains all the points.</p>
        <p>Use algorithms such as Graham's scan or Andrew's monotone chain to find the convex hull.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Given points [(1, 1), (2, 5), (3, 3), (5, 3), (3, 1), (4, 4)], return the convex hull in the form of a set of points forming the polygon.</li>
        </ul>
