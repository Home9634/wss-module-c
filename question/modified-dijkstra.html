        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Implement a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm that can handle dynamic edge weights and negative weights (though still with no negative cycles).</p>
        <p>The algorithm should return the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes, with modifications to handle updates in real-time.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Given a graph with nodes and edges, find the shortest paths from a source node using a modified version of Dijkstra.</li>
        </ul>
