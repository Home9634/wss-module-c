Given an array of integers, nums, and a target value, return the indices of the two numbers that add up to the target.
The inputs will be between -10^9 and 10^9 and the array length will not exceed 10^4.

Example:
Given nums = [2, 7, 11, 15] and target = 9, return the indices [0, 1].

Example:
Given nums = [3, 2, 4] and target = 6, return the indices [1, 2].

Example:
Given nums = [3, 3] and target = 6, return the indices [0, 1].
