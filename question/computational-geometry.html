        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Implement algorithms from computational geometry to solve problems such as finding the intersection of lines, convex hull, and closest pair of points.</p>
        <p>Use well-known geometric algorithms to perform tasks like checking if a point is inside a polygon or calculating the area of a polygon.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Given the points of a polygon [(1, 1), (2, 2), (3, 1)], calculate its area.</li>
        </ul>
