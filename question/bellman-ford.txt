Given a weighted directed graph, find the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes. The graph may have negative edge weights but no negative weight cycles.

Example:
Given a graph with edges [(0, 1, 5), (0, 2, 3), (1, 2, 2), (1, 3, 1)], return the shortest paths from node 0 to all other nodes.
