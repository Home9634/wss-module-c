        <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
        <p>Some problems require pre-calculation of results for optimization purposes. In this problem, pre-calculate all possible combinations or results within given constraints, and then use these pre-calculated results for efficient query answering.</p>
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Given a range [1, 100], pre-calculate the sum of all integers for each query in the range.</li>
        </ul>
